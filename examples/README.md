# Wing Examples

This directory contains a collection of Wing examples of the kinds of apps you can build in Wing! Check out the [Wing Contributor's Handbook](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-add-an-example) for a guide on on how to add your own example.

The examples in the `tests` directory are examples specifically used for testing the compiler. `tests/valid` are examples that should compile successfully, and `tests/invalid` are examples that should fail.

The examples in `proposed` are examples that may not yet work in the current version of Wing, but we want to make them work in the future!
