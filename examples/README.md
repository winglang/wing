# Wing Examples

This directory contains a collection of Wing examples of the kinds of apps you can build in Wing! Check out the [Wing Contributor's Handbook](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-add-an-example) for a guide on on how to add your own example.

The examples in the `tests` directory are examples specifically used for testing the compiler. `tests/valid` are examples that should compile successfully, and `tests/invalid` are examples that should fail.

The examples in `proposed` are examples that may not yet work in the current version of Wing, but we want to make them work in the future!

## Examples

_Add yours here!_

## Simple search engine

**Source code:** [./proposed/in-memory-search.w](./proposed/in-memory-search.w)
**Description:** This is a silly idea for a Wing app where cloud functions are used to create a search engine where the entire search index exists in-memory, spread across many lambda functions.

## Tweet queue

**Source code:** [./tweet-queue.w](./tweet-queue.w)
**Description:** This is a Wing app that lets you get a feed of Twitter search results into a queue. It works by periodically polling the freely available Twitter Standard Search API and sending all new tweets to the queue.
