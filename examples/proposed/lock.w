/**
 * A lock that can only be acquired by one inflight at a time.
 *
 * Internally, this uses a cloud.Counter to keep track of a number.
 * If the number is 0, the lock is free. If the number is 1, the lock
 * is acquired.
 *
 * This is a very simple lock, and it has a number of limitations:
  * - It is not reentrant. If a single inflight tries to acquire the lock
  *   twice, it may block forever.
  * - It is not fair. If multiple inflights are waiting to acquire the lock,
  *   there is no guarantee that they will acquire the lock in the order
  *   that they requested it.
  * - It is not stable. If an inflight crashes while holding the lock, the
  *   lock will be permanently stuck in the acquired state.
