## Opening Issues

One of the easiest ways to contribute to the Wing SDK is by opening [issues](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/new).
If you're reporting a bug, try to include detailed information including steps to reproduce it, and what you expected to happen.
If you're suggesting a feature or enhancement, please include information about your use case for it.

## Getting Started

Start by forking or cloning the repository. [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
is a great place to get started on this process.

## Prerequisites

These tools are needed to build the library and run unit tests:

- ???? (@sep)
- Your favorite code editor


To build the project, you also need to `npm login` into `@winglang` in order to install private npm packages.

### Setting up GitHub private packages

First, you need a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to login to the GitHub npm registry. Follow the instructions in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token) to create a PAT. Make sure it has the `read:packages` scope.

After, you should configure npm to use the @winglang package registry by default for the packages under the @winglang scope by running:

```sh
npm login --scope=@winglang --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

# > Username: GITHUB USERNAME
# > Password: YOUR PAT
# > Email: PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS
```

See [Working with the npm registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry) for more information.

### Setting up `insta` snapshot tool

Snapshot testing uses [insta](https://insta.rs/) tool to generate and compare snapshots. To install it, run:

```sh
cargo install cargo-insta
```

Recommended way to run tests and review snapshot changes:

```sh
cargo insta test --review
```
See https://insta.rs/docs/quickstart/ for more information.
If you prefer to avoid the `insta` tool, you may set INSTA_UPDATE to `always` to update snapshots without review with a regular test command:

```sh
INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo test
```

otherwise, `cargo test` fails if snapshots are out of date.

## Orientation


### `src` folder


## Setting up and building the project

Install the dependencies using npm:

```shell
cargo something
```

## Logs

You can enable debug output by setting the environment variable "DEBUG".  
It supports namespaces, so you can do:

```sh
export DEBUG="foo,bar" # to enable both "foo" and "bar"
export DEBUG="foo:*" # to enable all namespaces starting with "foo"
export DEBUG="*,-bar" # to enable all namespaces except "bar"
```

## Testing

### Sandbox


## Creating a resource

## Submitting a pull request

To ensure pull requests are reviewed and accepted as quickly as possible, please make sure:

[ ] Tests are written for all changes.

[ ] Hand-written documentation in `libs/wingc/README.md` is updated if features are being added or removed.

[ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive and pushed to your fork.

[ ] Your fork is in sync with the upstream repository.

Create a new pull request [here](https://github.com/winglang/wingsdk/compare), selecting your fork for the 'compare' 
and `main` for the 'base'. 

The title of the pull request should adhere to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). For example, 
if you're adding new features, the pull request title should start with `feat(sdk):`. If you are fixing a bug, then `fix(sdk):` 
should be the title prefix.

In the description reference any open issues that the changes resolve. Describe the changes you made and include anything
you think would be useful for a reviewer to know. It's also a great place to add a shout-out to anyone who helped with the 
changes.
