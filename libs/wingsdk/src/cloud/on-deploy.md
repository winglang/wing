The `cloud.OnDeploy` resource runs a block of inflight code each time the application is deployed.

## Usage

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// each time the application is deployed, all objects in the bucket are deleted
let setup = new cloud.OnDeploy(inflight () => {
  for key in bucket.list() {
    bucket.delete(key);
  }
});
```
