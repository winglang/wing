The `cloud.Queue` resource represents a data structure for holding a list of messages.
Queues are typically used to decouple producers of data and the consumers of said data in distributed systems.
Queues by default are not FIFO (first in, first out) - so the order of messages is not guaranteed.

## Usage

### Setting a Queue Consumer

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let q = new cloud.Queue();

q.setConsumer(inflight (m: str) => {
  log("message ${m} consumed");
});

new cloud.Function(inflight () => {
  q.push("message a");
  q.push("message b");
});
```

### Using Queue inflight api

Pusing messages, popping them, and purge

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let q = new cloud.Queue();

new cloud.Function(inflight () => {
  q.push("message a");
  q.push("message b", "message c", "message d");
  log("approxSize is ${q.approxSize()}");
  log("popping message ${q.pop()}");
  log("popping message ${q.pop()}");
  log("approxSize is ${q.approxSize()}");
  q.purge();
  log("approxSize is ${q.approxSize()}");
});
```
