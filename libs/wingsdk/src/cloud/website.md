The `cloud.Website` resource represents a static website that can be hosted in the cloud.
Websites are typically used to serve static content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which are updated whenever the application is redeployed.

## Usage

### Website

```ts
bring cloud;

let website = new cloud.Website(path: "./public");
```

Under `./public/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  Hello Winglang!!!
</html>
```
