# tree-sitter-wing

A tree-sitter parser for the Wing language.

Wing is still heavily in development and this grammar/parser is experimental. It is used directly in the Wing compiler and is not considered a public API. It is available here for use but may have breaking changes at any time and no bindings are published or guaranteed to be work.

## Contributing

Issues are tracked as part of the [Wing](https://github.com/winglang/wing) repository.
