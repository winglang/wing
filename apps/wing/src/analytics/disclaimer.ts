We are working hard to make this a great tool, but there's still a pretty good
chance you'll encounter missing pieces, rough edges, performance issues and even,
god forbid, bugs üêû.

Please don't hesitate to ping us at ${chalk.blueBright.bold.underline(

To help us identify issues early, we are collecting anonymous analytics.
