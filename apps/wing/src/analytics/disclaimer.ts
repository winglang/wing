üß™ This is an early pre-release of the Wing Programming Language (aka "alpha").
  
We are working hard to make this a great tool, but there's still a pretty good
chance you'll encounter missing pieces, rough edges, performance issues and even,
god forbid, bugs üêû.

Please don't hesitate to ping us at ${chalk.blueBright.bold.underline(
      "https://t.winglang.io/slack"
    )} or file an issue at
${chalk.blueBright.bold.underline(
  "https://github.com/winglang/wing"
)}. We promise to do our best to respond quickly and help out.

To help us identify issues early, we are collecting anonymous analytics.
To turn this off, set ${chalk.yellowBright.bold("WING_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=1")}.
