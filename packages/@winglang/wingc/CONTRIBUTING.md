## Opening Issues

One of the easiest ways to contribute to the Wing SDK is by opening [issues](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/new).
If you're reporting a bug, try to include detailed information including steps to reproduce it, and what you expected to happen.
If you're suggesting a feature or enhancement, please include information about your use case for it.

## Getting Started

Start by forking or cloning the repository. [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
is a great place to get started on this process.

## Prerequisites

These tools are needed to build the library and run unit tests:

- ???? (@sep)
- Your favorite code editor

## Orientation

### `src` folder

## Setting up and building the project

Install the dependencies using npm:

```sh
cargo something
```

## Logs

You can enable debug output by setting the environment variable "DEBUG".  
It supports namespaces, so you can do:

```sh
export DEBUG="foo,bar" # to enable both "foo" and "bar"
export DEBUG="foo:*" # to enable all namespaces starting with "foo"
export DEBUG="*,-bar" # to enable all namespaces except "bar"
```

## Testing

## Creating a resource

## Submitting a pull request

To ensure pull requests are reviewed and accepted as quickly as possible, please make sure:

[ ] Tests are written for all changes.

[ ] Hand-written documentation in `packages/@winglang/wingc/README.md` is updated if features are being added or removed.

[ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive and pushed to your fork.

[ ] Your fork is in sync with the upstream repository.

Create a new pull request [here](https://github.com/winglang/wingsdk/compare), selecting your fork for the 'compare'
and `main` for the 'base'.

The title of the pull request should adhere to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). For example,
if you're adding new features, the pull request title should start with `feat(sdk):`. If you are fixing a bug, then `fix(sdk):`
should be the title prefix.

In the description reference any open issues that the changes resolve. Describe the changes you made and include anything
you think would be useful for a reviewer to know. It's also a great place to add a shout-out to anyone who helped with the
changes.
