:::caution Maturity: Alpha

Under active development.

:::

**Wing is very young, naive, and currently under active development**. This
means that we still don't think it's a very useful tool at the moment, and
definitely not ready for production use. Many of the APIs and language features
will likely change in the coming months.

However, it's definitely ready for those brave of hearts who would like to be
involved at this early stage, influence our roadmap and join us for the ride.

We are hard at work to get it to a state where it is ready to be used for real
world projects (let's call it **Beta**). To that end, we need to cover
sufficient surface area across the various components.

## Roadmap

We manage our project roadmap through GitHub projects, which should offer an
up-to-date view on what we've completed, what we are working on and our backlog.

* [Compiler Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/winglang/projects/1)
* [Standard Library Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/winglang/projects/3)
* [Beta Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/winglang/projects/2)
