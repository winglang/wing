**You are about to go through your first-time experience with Wing!**

Going through a first-time experience with a shiny new tool is a very exciting
event. It's a discovery of a new world of ideas, concepts and technology.

We want this guide to be really fun, easy to read and to offer exactly the
*right* amount of depth into the concepts and ideas behind Wing, so it's not too
confusing or overwhelming. Naturally, it will take us some time to make this an
awesome experience, and we would love your feedback and help! :pray:

New experiences are always better with friends and support, [join](https://t.winglang.io/slack) 
the **Wing Community Slack** and jump right into the [#getting-started](https://winglang.slack.com/archives/C04BBDQUWQP) 
channel. Say :wave: and feel free to ask questions, post rants and 
offer advice to your fellow Wingnuts.

If you run into issues, please submit a [new
issue](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/new/choose) on GitHub and let us
know as soon as possible.

So without further ado, let's get this party started!
