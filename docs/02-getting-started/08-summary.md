Congratulations on building your very first Wing application. We hope that this guide was helpful
in demonstrating the power of the abstractions the Wing Language.

## A quick recap

Let's quickly walk through everything we've done together:

1. We've written a simple [Hello, World!](./03-hello.md) program.
2. We've learned about **compilation targets** and [compiled](./04-compile.md)
   our program to the `sim` target, which created an `hello.wsim` file that includes
   a simulated version of our entire cloud application.
3. We've explored and interacted with our app through the [Wing Console](./05-console.md).
4. Then we've loaded our app into an instance of the `Simulator` class and
   interacted with the simulator [programmatically](./06-simulator.md) through
   the Node.js REPL.
5. We've compiled our app to [Terraform/AWS](./07-aws.md), deployed it into an
   AWS account and used through the AWS Management Console.

## What's next?

Here's some recommended reading:

- [Contributor's Handbook](../contributors/handbook) - the one-stop shop for contributing to Wing.
- [Concepts](../category/concepts) - a collection of topics on various concepts of the Wing language.
- [Language Specification](../reference/spec) - the full specification of the language
  (note that it is not fully implemented yet).
- [SDK Reference](../reference/sdk) - the API reference for the Wing SDK.
