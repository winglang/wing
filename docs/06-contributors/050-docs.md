## üìï How do I update documentation

Our documentation lives under the [`docs`](https://github.com/winglang/wing/tree/main/docs)
directory of the Wing GitHub repository. 

To propose an update to the docs, simply submit a pull request against the relevant markdown file.

## üìï Can I view the local documentation website on my machine?

Yes, you can! We use the awesome [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) project for our docs.

To start the documentation website, run the following command from the root of the repo:

```sh
npm run docs
```

This magical script will clone the [winglang/docsite](https://github.com/winglang/docsite)
repository into `~/.winglang-docsite`, symlink your local copy into it and start a browser with the
site.

## üñºÔ∏è How do I add an example?

Adding a code example is a great way to contribute to Wing.  Here's how to do it:

* Fork this repository on GitHub.
* Create a new branch for your example.
* Add your Wing code to the `examples` directory.
  * If your example involves multiple files, create a dedicated directory for it.
* Add a link to your example to the `examples/README.md` file.
* Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
* Open a pull request. A Wing maintainer will review it as soon as possible!
