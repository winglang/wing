This topic includes a description of common development workflows for the Wing project.

## Environment Setup

Here is a list of minimal tools you should install to build the Wing repo in your development
environment:

* [Node.js] v18 and npm v8
  * We recommend [volta] to manage node tools
* [Rust]
* [AWS CLI]
  * Only needed for integration tests - make sure to do the setup part to create credentials
* [Terraform CLI]
  * Only needed for integration tests
* [Docker] or [emscripten]
  * Only needed for to build the grammar as WASM for the web-based playground

Installation:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/winglang/wing
cd wing
npm install
```

:::note Nx Commands
[Nx] commands in this document are structured as

```sh
npx nx <target> <project>
# or
npx nx <target> <project> -- <args>

```

- `npx` can be omitted if [Nx] is installed globally
- `<project>` may be omitted if the current working directory is within the given project directory. If not within any project directory, it will default to the `winglang` CLI project
- If any paths are present in `<args>`, ensure they are either absolute or relative to the project directory

## Full build

If you wish to perform a full build (similar to the one CI is running), just run this from the root:

```sh
npm run build
```

It will run the `build`, `test` and `package` targets on all modules.


## üè† What's the recommended development workflow?

The `npx nx wing` command can be executed from the root of the repository in order to build and run the
compiler, SDK and the Wing CLI. Nx is configured to make sure only the changed components are built
every time.

To get full diagnostics, use these exports:

```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--stack-trace-limit=100
export RUST_BACKTRACE=full
```

Now, you can edit a source file anywhere across the stack and run the compiler with arguments.
For example:

```sh
npx nx wing -- test ../../examples/tests/valid/captures.w
```

This command runs the full Wing CLI with the given arguments. Nx will ensure the CLI build is updated.

## How is the repository structured?

The Wing repository is structured as a monorepo, which means that it contains multiple packages.
Packages that are primarily meant to be run by users are in the `apps` directory, while packages
that are primarily meant to be consumed as libraries are in the `libs` directory. Some packages are
written in Rust, while others are written in TypeScript. Each has a README explaining what it does
and how to use it. (If you see one missing, please open an issue and let us know!)

The Wing monorepo uses [Nx] to run commands across all code packages in the `libs` and `apps`
folders. This means it includes packages that form the entire toolchain (compiler, SDK, IDE
extension, etc), and the build and release bind them all together.

Nx will be installed alongside the rest of the project's dependencies after you run `npm install`
from the root directory, and can be accessed with `npx nx` (it does not need to be installed
separately).

:::note

The first time you run `npm install` you may be asked to enter your system password, this is because
it's taking care of installing the [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) for you.

If you wish to install it manually, you may do so by running `scripts/setup_wasi.sh`

## üß™ How do I run tests?

End-to-end tests are hosted under `./tools/hangar`. To get started, first ensure you can [build
wing](#-how-do-i-build-wing).

To run the tests (and update snapshots), run the following command from anywhere in the monorepo:

```sh
npx nx test hangar
```

## How do I work only on the compiler?

The following command runs the cargo tests, currently just ensures the valid examples compile and the
invalid ones do not.

```sh
npx nx test wingc
```

The following command runs `wingc` on a file. This performs all the compilation steps. Run from the root or `apps/wing`.

```sh
npx nx wing -- compile <path to a .w file (full path, or relative to the location of the apps/wing folder)>
```

You can find the compilation artifacts in the apps/wing/targets folder

## How do I make changes to the Wing grammar?

After making changes to `grammar.js`, run:

```sh
npx nx build tree-sitter-wing
```

To run the grammar tests (that are located in the `test` folder):

```sh
npx nx test tree-sitter-wing
```

To build the grammar as WASM for the web-based playground. Leave off `--docker` if you have emscripten
setup locally:

```sh
npx tree-sitter-cli build-wasm --docker
```

To use the wasm grammar to run a web-based playground where you can explore the AST and test out
highlight queries, run:

```sh
npx tree-sitter-cli playground
```

Make sure to also run `build-wasm` before each time the grammar changes

## üî® How do I build the VSCode extension?

The VSCode extension is located in `apps/vscode-wing`. Most of the "logic" is in the language server, which
is located in the Wing CLI at `apps/wing/src/commands/lsp.ts`. 

To build the extension (also creates an installable `.vsix` file):

```sh
npx nx build vscode-wing
```

To run a new isolated VSCode instance with the extension installed:

```sh
npx nx dev vscode-wing
```

To modify the package.json, make sure to edit `.projenrc.ts` and rebuild.
