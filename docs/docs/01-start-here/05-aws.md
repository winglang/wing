So far we've tested our program locally using our Wing Console. Next we'll see how you can deploy your
program to AWS using Terraform.

## Wing compiler supports multiple targets

The Wing compiler supports multiple compilation targets. Each resource in the
Wing ecosystem can support any number of *backends*. For example, the
`cloud.Queue` resource we used in our app can be backed by [Amazon
SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) by [Azure Queue
Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/queues/) or by
[RabbitMQ by CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/).

A target represents both the cloud provider and the provisioning engine. For
example, the `tf-aws` target will compile your program to a set of AWS
resources, using Terraform as the provisioning engine.


:::info Under Construction

:construction: We plan to also support [Azure](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:azure) and [Google Cloud](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:gcp) as targets out of
the box. In addition, we are planning support for other provisioning engines
such as AWS CloudFormation and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

In order to deploy to AWS, you will need:

* [Terraform](https://terraform.io/downloads)
* AWS CLI with configured credentials. See
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
for more information.

## Compile to Terraform/AWS

We will use the `tf-aws` target to tell the compiler to bind all of our resources
to the default set of AWS resources and use Terraform as the provisioning engine.

```sh
wing compile --target tf-aws hello.w
```

## Examine the output

Our `target` directory now contains a `hello.tfaws` directory which has all of the Terraform configuration for this application.

## Initialize Terraform state

Now, let's deploy our program to AWS.

:::tip Credentials Required

You will need to have AWS credentials configured on your system. See
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
for more information.

:::

Let's change the working directory to where our Terraform configuration is and
initialize the state file:

```sh
cd ./target/hello.tfaws
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1 # or any other region
terraform init
```

## Terraform deploy

Now we are ready to deploy to our AWS account:

```sh
terraform apply
```

You should expect output similar to this: 
```sh
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_iam_role.cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_IamRole_2548D828 will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_role" "cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_IamRole_2548D828" {...}

  # aws_iam_role_policy.cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_IamRolePolicy_37133937 will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_IamRolePolicy_37133937" {...}

  # aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_IamRolePolicyAttachment_45079F65 will be created
  + resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_IamRolePolicyAttachment_45079F65" {...}

  # aws_lambda_event_source_mapping.cloudQueue_EventSourceMapping_41814136 will be created
  + resource "aws_lambda_event_source_mapping" "cloudQueue_EventSourceMapping_41814136" {...}

  # aws_lambda_function.cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e will be created
  + resource "aws_lambda_function" "cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e" {...}

  # aws_s3_bucket.Code will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "Code" {...}

  # aws_s3_bucket.cloudBucket will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "cloudBucket" {...}

  # aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.cloudBucket_PublicAccessBlock_5946CCE8 will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "cloudBucket_PublicAccessBlock_5946CCE8" {...}

  # aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration.cloudBucket_Encryption_77B6AEEF will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "cloudBucket_Encryption_77B6AEEF" {...}

  # aws_s3_object.cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_S3Object_8868B9FB will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_object" "cloudQueue-SetConsumer-cdafee6e_S3Object_8868B9FB" {...}

  # aws_sqs_queue.cloudQueue will be created
  + resource "aws_sqs_queue" "cloudQueue" {...}

Plan: 11 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

If you choose to proceed, Terraform will do its magic and will create all of these resources in your
account.

```  
Apply complete! Resources: 11 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

## Explore your app on AWS

After our application has been deployed to AWS, you should be able to interact with it
through the AWS Management Console.

1. Open the [Amazon SQS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs)
2. Select your AWS region
3. You should be able to see that you have a queue there
4. Click **Send and receive messages**.
5. In the **Message Body** box type `cloud` and hit **Send message**.
6. Jump over to the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets) 
7. There should be some buckets prefixed with `cloud-bucket-`. 
8. Cycle through the buckets until you find one that contains `wing.txt`.
9. Click `wing.txt` then click the `Open` button.
10. The file should contain `Hello, cloud`.

## Cleanup

Terraform doesn't allow destroying a non-empty bucket by default. To prepare for
easy cleanup, you may delete the newly created file by marking the checkbox next
to `wing.txt`, clicking the `Delete` button, typing `permanently delete` in the
confirmation box and clicking the `Delete objects` button.

Once you're done, you can destroy all of the resources that were created on your AWS account by running:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
