To learn more, check out the rest of our docs where we cover all the basics with Wing, or check out our [examples repository](https://github.com/winglang/examples) to see some samples of Wing applications.

We also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@winglangio) where we share clips of demos and interviews with guests, and a [blog](https://docs.winglang.io/blog).

Finally, we encourage you to join our [Wing Slack](http://t.winglang.io/slack).
We're here to help each other, answer questions, and share our cloud adventures.
