### Documentation

Learn about Wing's [core concepts](https://www.winglang.io/docs/category/core-concepts), including Wing's main differentiator, the [preflight and inflight execution phases](https://www.winglang.io/docs/concepts/inflights).

Or check out the documentation of the varios resources in Wing's [standard library](https://www.winglang.io/docs/category/standard-library) which abstracts the cloud.

You can also check out Wing's [toolchain](https://www.winglang.io/docs/category/tools), including the [platforms](https://www.winglang.io/docs/concepts/platforms) that allow you to go below the abstraction layer and tweak the infrastructure definitions directly.
