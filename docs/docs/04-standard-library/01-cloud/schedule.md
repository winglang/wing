The `cloud.Schedule` resource is used to trigger events at a regular interval.
Schedules are useful for periodic tasks, such as running backups or sending daily reports.
The timezone used in cron expressions is always UTC.

## Usage

### From cron

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let schedule = new cloud.Schedule(cron: "* * * * ?");

schedule.onTick(inflight () => {
  log("schedule: triggered");
});
```

### From rate

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let schedule = new cloud.Schedule(rate: 1m);

schedule.onTick(inflight () => {
  log("schedule: triggered");
});
```

### Simulator (`sim`)

A standard JavaScript `setTimeout` function triggers ticks as callbacks.
