The `cloud.OnDeploy` resource runs a block of inflight code each time the application is deployed.

## Usage

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// each time the application is deployed, all objects in the bucket are deleted
let setup = new cloud.OnDeploy(inflight () => {
  for key in bucket.list() {
    bucket.delete(key);
  }
});
```

To specify that the `cloud.OnDeploy` resource should be run before or after another resource is created or updated, use the `executeBefore` or `executeAfter` properties:

```ts playground
bring cloud;

let counter = new cloud.Counter();

let setup2 = new cloud.OnDeploy(inflight () => {
  counter.inc();
}) as "setup2";
let setup1 = new cloud.OnDeploy(inflight () => {
  counter.set(10);
}, executeBefore: [setup2]) as "setup1";
```
