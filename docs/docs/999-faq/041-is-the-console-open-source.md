Unlike the rest of the wing repo, which is open-source under the MIT license, the console is source-available.
It means that you can see the source code, report bugs in it and contribute modifications, but you can't use it for commercial purposes.

You can see the full details of the license [here](https://github.com/winglang/wing/blob/main/wing-console/LICENSE.md).

The license for the rest of the repo is [MIT](https://github.com/winglang/wing/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
