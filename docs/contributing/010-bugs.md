## üêû How do I submit a bug report?

Wing is a work in progress! Our goal is to to keep the toolchain stable, and to minimize surprising
behavior as new features are added -- but even then, sometimes bugs slip through.

If you spot a bug or any behavior that doesn't match how you expected it to work, please go to our
GitHub and [open an issue](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/new). A Wing maintainer will come
to triage it and identify where the problem is, and if there's a way we can fix it.

Also, if you think you have an idea of where the bug is, or even think you might be able to fix it
-- please let us know in the issue! We can give you some pointers and help you get started.
