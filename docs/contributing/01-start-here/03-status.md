## üß™ This is a pre-release

**Wing is very young, naive, and currently under active development**. This
means that we still don't think it's a very useful tool at the moment, and
probably not ready for production use. Many of the APIs and language features
will likely change in the coming months.

However, it's definitely ready for those brave of hearts who would like to be
involved at this early stage, influence our roadmap and join us for the ride.

We are working hard to make this a great tool, but there's still a pretty good 
chance you'll encounter missing pieces, rough edges, performance issues and even,
god forbid, bugs üêû. 

Please don't hesitate to ping us on [Slack](https://t.winglang.io/slack) or 
[file an issue](https://github.com/winglang/wing). We promise to do our best to
respond quickly and help out.

## Roadmap

We manage our project roadmap through GitHub projects, which should offer an
up-to-date view on what we've completed, what we are working on and our backlog.
