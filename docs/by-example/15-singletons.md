Singletons let you define a resource only once per application. 

This example shows a pattern for how to implement singletons in Wing.

As an example, say we want to maintain a central bucket that can be accessed from any part of the
application:

```js title="main.w" playground example
bring cloud;

class SingletonBucket {
  pub static of(scope: std.IResource): cloud.Bucket {
    let uid = "SingletonBucket";
    let root = nodeof(scope).root;
    let rootNode = nodeof(root);
    return unsafeCast(rootNode.tryFindChild(uid)) ?? new cloud.Bucket() as uid in root;
  }
}
```

The `SingletonBucket.of()` static method uses `std.Node.of(scope).root` to find the root node of the app.
Then, if there is already a child with the identifier `SingletonBucket` at that level, it returns
it or otherwise it creates a new bucket with this id (`as uid`) under the root node (`in root`).

> `unsafeCast()` is needed here to cast the returned object from `tryFindChild()` to `cloud.Bucket`.

Now, in order to access our bucket from anywhere within the app, I can just use:

```js
class MyFoo {
  new() {
    let bucket = SingletonBucket.of(this);
  }
}
```

And we will always get the same bucket.

> NOTE: if you use `this` in an entrypoint (outside of a class declaration), its type is going to be `Construct`
> (known issue: [#6049](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/6049)), so you can use `unsafeCast` as a workaround:

```js
let bucket = SingletonBucket.of(unsafeCast(this));
```
