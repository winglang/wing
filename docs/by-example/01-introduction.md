Wing is an open source programming language for the cloud. Wing combines infrastructure and runtime code in one language, enabling developers to stay in their creative flow, and to deliver better software, faster and more securely.

**Wing by Example** is a hands-on introduction to Wing using annotated example programs. Check out the first example or browse the list using the navigation.

Unless stated otherwise, examples here assume the latest major release of Wing and may use new language features. If something isn't working and upgrading to the latest version doesn't fix it, please [open an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/new/choose) or [send us a message on Discord](https://t.winglang.io/discord)!
