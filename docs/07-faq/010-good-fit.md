Wing was built from the ground up to make it an ideal choice for building applications on any cloud.
It includes an assembly of different features that serve that purpose:

* [Cloud services](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/resources) as first-class citizens, with [phase modifiers](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#13-phase-modifiers) for config or runtime (`preflight` and `inflight`).
* Higher level of cloud abstraction with a [standard library](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/wingsdk-spec).
* [Distributed computing primitives](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights).
* [Compiler plugins](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/compiler-plugins) that can be used to customize the compilation output, such as infrastructure definitions.
* [JavaScript interoperability](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#5-interoperability).
* Automatic generation of IAM policies and other cloud mechanics based on intent.
* [Native JSON](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#114-json-type) and schema validation support.
* [Default immutability](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2023/02/02/good-cognitive-friction#immutable-by-default).
* [Implicit async](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#113-asynchronous-model), explicit defer.
