## Terraform Resources
You can use any resource from the vast [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) in your Wing applications as explained [here](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/489).

## Custom Terraform Modules
You can import custom Terraform modules into Wing if they have a CDKTF provider.
