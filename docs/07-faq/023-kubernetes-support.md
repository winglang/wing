Not yet but we will in the future. Our roadmap is [here](https://docs.winglang.io/status#roadmap).

You can add your vote for Kubernetes on [this issue](https://github.com/winglang/wing/issues/2066) to help increase its priority.

We currently have full support for Terraform. AWS CDK (based on CloudFormation) is also supported by the community.
