## compatibility matrix automation

A small program that is used for taking test output files, and use them in order to update the compatibility matrix (can be found here: https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/compatibility-matrix)

To run the script:

```
OUT_FOLDER=<path to the output files relative to this folder> npx update-matrix
```
