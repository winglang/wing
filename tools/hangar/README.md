# Hangar - Wing Test Suite

Assumptions:
- node and npm are installed and available on the path
- Wing tarball is available locally via path at HANGAR_WING_TGZ
- wingsdk should be resolvable by npm, either through the internet or (ideally) via a local cache stored in `./tmp/.npm` (`npm cache add`)

Ideas for later:
