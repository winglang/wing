# Welcome! :wave:

**Wing** is a [cloud-oriented programming language]. It is a modern,
object-oriented, and strongly-typed language. Most programming languages think
about computers as machines. In Wing, ***the cloud is the computer***.

Wing applications compile to Terraform and JavaScript that are ready to deploy
to your favorite cloud provider, and can also be tested in your local
environment using the [Wing Console](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/console).

[cloud-oriented programming language]: https://docs.winglang.io/#what-is-a-cloud-oriented-language

```js
bring cloud;

let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

new cloud.Function(inflight (event: str): str => {
  bucket.put("greeting.txt", "hello, world!");
});
```

## This is Alpha

Wing is in its very early stages of development and not recommended for
production use. Many features are still missing, and APIs will dramatically
evolve in the coming months. We are excited for anyone to take part in
influencing the direction of every part of this project.

Our <a href="https://docs.winglang.io/status">Project Status</a> page includes
more information about stability and roadmap üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
