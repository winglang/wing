# The Wing Programming Language

Wing Programming Language reference implementation.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - or on Mac - `arch -arm64 brew install cmake`
- **Graphviz** - run `arch -arm64 brew install graphviz`

You also need to `npm login` into `@monadahq`.

## `wingc` Compiler

The compiler is under `wingc` and you can use standard Rust workflows:

- `cargo build` - builds the code
- `cargo test` - runs tests
- `cargo test -- --nocapture` - runs tests with output to see compilation results

## `wingrt` Runtime

The runtime that executes output of the compiler - it is under `wingrt`.

Currently local compilation is complicated and takes a lot of time, it requires
building a special variant of Node, blood sacrifice, and dark rituals.

Pre-built binaries are available at:
[winglang-infra](https://github.com/monadahq/winglang-infra).

Get the binaries for your platform and place them under `wingrt/vendor/node`. For this, you need to unzip the file and put the "include" and "lib" folders directly under `wingrt/vendor/node`.
If you are on an apple silicone Mac then use `actual-libnode-macos-latest-arm64.zip` and not `libnode-macos-latest-arm64.zip`.

You also need to build the compiler (`wingc`) first: `cargo build --release`.

Then you should make sure that you've setup Github private packages on your machine.
Instructions are in [this KB](https://github.com/monadahq/mona-kb/blob/main/docs/github-private-packages.md).

You should also make sure you have cmake installed, see [here](http://cmake.org), or on Mac just use `arch -arm64 brew install cmake`

After that you should be able to build and run the runtime tests with:

```bash
npm install
npm test
# incremental recompiles
npm run cmake
```
**Troubleshoot #1:** if you get this error: "fatal error: 'v8.h' file not found" then you need to make sure you put the pre-built binaries correctly in `wingrt/vendor/node`.

**Troubleshoot #2:** if you get this error: "linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)" then you need to run `npm run clean`.

IF everything is fine, then you should be able to run the CLI with:

```bash
./build/wingrt 
```

## `wing`

The meta wrapper CLI binary, Wing's `cargo`.

## Wing SDK

The Wing SDK is the standard library of the Wing programming language. The SDK
is maintained under the [monadahq/wingsdk](https://github.com/monadahq/wingsdk)
repository and released as a private npm module called
[`@monadahq/wingsdk`](https://github.com/monadahq/wingsdk/packages/1519521).

The `wing` folder in this repository has a `package.json` file that simply takes
a dependency on the SDK package, so running `npm install` will bring it over.

### Local SDK Development

If you wish to develop the SDK alongside the compiler, simply clone the SDK
repository side-by-side with the compiler and use `npm link` in the playground:

Clone and build the SDK, and capture it as a linked package:

```sh
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:monadahq/wingsdk
cd wingsdk
yarn
yarn build
yarn link
```

Clone the winglang repo and attach the linked SDK:

```sh
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:monadahq/winglang
cd winglang/playground
npm run link-sdk
```

You will likely want to watch for changes in the SDK directory:

```sh
cd ~/workspace/wingsdk
yarn watch
```

And in another terminal, you can start iterating:

```sh
cd ~/workspace/winglang/playground
./wingc examples/test.w
```

### Language Corpus

Examples of Wing code are located in the [corpus](./corpus) directory.
