# The Wing Programming Language

## Welcome!

Wing is the first cloud oriented programming language. It is a statically typed,
compiled language that allows developers to write their application and the infrastructure flows from code.

```wing
bring cloud;

let queue = new cloud.Queue();

queue.on_message((message: str) ~> {
  print("Hello, ${message}!");
});
```

Wing allows developers to leverage the cloud naturally within their code. 
It is designed to be a general-purpose language that can be used to build any type of cloud application.

The Wing compiler can target multiple cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure,
Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. It can also target a local cloud simulator,
allowing developers to run their applications locally for testing and debugging
using the Wing Console.

*This README is for *users* of the language. It contains information about how
to install the toolchain, and how to build Wing applications. If you wish to
*contribute* to the project, please jump over to our [contribution
guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).*

## Concepts and Glossary

Before the cloud, things were simple. There was a clear separation of concerns between developers and operations. Developers were focusing on business problems and didn't have to worry or think about operational concerns. The application could be entirely developed and tested locally.

Operations then took care of the security, networking, availability, deployment, and scaling concerns. Developers would send their code "over the fence" and let operations take it from there.

As the cloud evolved the complexity of reliable applications increased and code was moved to the operations side of the world. Operations and development lines blurred and DevOps was created. While this increased reliability and performance in large-scale cloud applications, it also hurt the local development experience. Developers started fighting slow "inner loop" iteration cycles as things were moved out code and into managed services. Developers now have to care about non-functional concerns while operations is more intertwined with the development cycle. 

Wing addresses the problems by providing a language and toolchain that allows the developer to define intent and the compiler handles the complexity of interweaving the infrastructure with the functional code.

```wing
bring cloud

let bucket = cloud.Bucket()
cloud.Function() {[
  bucket.upload("hello.txt", "world") 
]}
```


Wing introduces a few new terms into the developer lexicon that you'll see used throughout the documentation.

* Preflight code - code that represents infrastructure components key to your cloud applications. For example, a queue or REST endpoint resource is created using preflight code.
* Inflight code - code that represents runtime business logic. For example, a function that processes messages from a queue and writes records to a database.

## Getting Started

If you want to try out Wing without having to get anything installed locally, 
check out the [wing playground](https://wing-playground.vercel.app/).

### Prerequisites

To install Wing, you will need the following installed on your system:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18.x or above). We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js.
1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our supported IDE. You can use other IDEs, but we have a VSCode extension to make development easier.

In order to deploy the "Hello, World" example below to AWS, you will also need:

1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
   is only needed to configure local credentials.
1. [Terraform](https://terraform.io/downloads) is needed to deploy to the cloud.

#### Authenticate to GitHub Packages

Since Wing is currently in private beta and distributed through a Monada's
private npm registry, you will need to login to the registry before installing:

```sh
$ npm login --scope=@monadahq --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
Username: YOUR GITHUB USERNAME
Password: YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN
Email: PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS
```

> To generate a token go to your GitHub account and select **Developer
settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Generate new token**. Make sure to
include permissions for the **read:packages** scope (see
[docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)).

#### AWS Account and Credentials

To deploy Wing applications to the AWS Cloud, you'll need an [AWS
account](portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) and [AWS
credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
configured on your system. You'll know you have it set up correctly when you can run this command and get back a successful result:

```shell
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Installation

Now you should be able to install the **Wing CLI**:

```sh
$ npm install -g @monadahq/wing
```

Next, install the **Wing Extension for VSCode**:

Download the extension [here](https://github.com/monadahq/winglang/releases/download/development/vscode-wing.vsix).

You can install it using the command line:

```shell 
$ code --install-extension ~/Downloads/vscode-wing.vsix
```

*Change the location in the command to where ever you saved the extension at.*

### Hello, Wing!

OK, we are ready to write our first Wing program!

Create a new file called `hello.w` with the following code:

```ts
bring cloud;

let queue = new cloud.Queue();

queue.on_message((message) ~> {
  print("Hello, ${message}!");
});
```

Now, let's test our program:

```sh
$ wing run hello.w
Compiling to target "sim"...
Starting Wing Console...
```

The **Wing Console** app will start and in the main view you'll see two
resources: a **Queue** and a **Function**. You'll also notice that the function
is connected to the queue through the `message` event.

Now, right-click on the queue and choose **Push Message**. Type `world` and hit
**Send**.

You'll notice that the log window shows a few events and then prints your
`Hello, world!` log. ***Congratulations! You have just written and tested your
first Wing program!***

As you can see, so far we've tested our program locally using the simulator and
Wing Console. Next we'll see how you can deploy your program to AWS using
Terraform.

> Currently, our SDKs only support AWS, but the Wing compiler can target
> multiple cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes.
> We are working on adding support for other cloud providers.

First, we need to compile our program to AWS:

```sh
$ wing build --target tf-aws hello.w

Build for target "tf-aws"...
```

Now, let's deploy our program to AWS:

> You will need to have AWS credentials configured on your system. See
> [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
> for more information.

```sh
$ cd ./target/tf-aws
$ export AWS_REGION=us-east-1 # or any other region
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

Now, if you open the [Amazon SQS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs),
select your AWS region, and you should be able to see that you have a queue
there. Click **Send and receive messages**, in the **Message Body** box type
`cloud` and hit **Send message**.

Now, jump over to the [CloudWatch
Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) and under **Log groups** you
should see a log group called `/aws/lambda/...`. Click on it and you should see
the log message `Hello, cloud!`.

## Staying up to date

The entire Wing toolchain is continuously released. We follow [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/) and release notes are available in the
[Releases](https://github.com/monadahq/winglang/releases) pages on GitHub.

To update the toolchain to the latest, run the following command:

```sh
$ npm update -g @monadahq/wing
```

Our VSCode extension has automatic updates, as well as the Wing Console.
