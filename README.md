**Winglang** is a new open-source programming language designed for the cloud (aka "*cloud-oriented*"). Wing enables developers to build distributed systems that leverage cloud services as first-class citizens by combining infrastructure ***and*** code.
Wing programs can be executed locally (*yes, no internet required*) using a fully-functional simulator, or deployed to any cloud provider (*yes, Wing programs are portable across providers*).

Our mission is to bring back your creative flow and close the gap between imagination and creation. Wing elevates your cloud development experience to new heights (the puns are just inevitable so bear with us)! üöÄ

Wing is built by [Elad Ben-Israel](https://github.com/eladb), the guy behind the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), the gang at [Monada](https://monada.co) and an amazing [community](https://t.winglang.io/slack) of contributors (also known as Wingnuts).

## What's so special about Wing? ü§î

Wing takes a unique approach to cloud development - instead of thinking about computers as individuals machines, it treats the ***entire cloud as the computer***.
By abstracting the cloud, Wing allows anyone building cloud applications to focus on their business logic and choose the target cloud at compile time.

The result? While your main code is written in Wing, the compilation artifacts are JavaScript and Terraform (with more provisioning engines on the way), meaning Wing can fit seamlessly into your existing stack!

In addition, Wing provides a built-in local simulator, and an observability & debugging [console](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/console), making it easier for you to reduce cognitive load and context switching, enabling you to stay in your creative flow.

Here's a taste of what Wing code looks like:

```js
bring cloud;

// This code defines a bucket as part of your application.
// At compile time, it will be substituted by an implementation
// for the target cloud provider.
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// Here we are able to interact with infra config of the bucket
bucket.public = true;

// An `inflight` represents code that runs later, on other machines,
// and can interact with any cloud resources
let hello_world = inflight () => {
  bucket.put("hello.txt", "Hello, World!");
};

// We can deploy the inflight as a serverless function
// (or in the future as a long-running service, etc.)
new cloud.Function(hello_world);
```

> ### Note for cloud experts ü§ì
>
> To give full control over how applications are deployed, Wing lets you customize **operational details** in a few ways:
>
> 1. by creating a [compiler plugin](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/compiler-plugins) that modifies the generated Terraform, or 
> 2. by providing implementations of built-in resources like `cloud.Bucket`, or
> 3. by developing your own custom resources.
>
> This layer of separation allows you to refactor code and write unit tests that focus on the business logic, while still having the flexibility to make changes under the hood.

## Getting started üõ†Ô∏è

> üöß Wing is still in alpha, and not recommended for production use. But we're excited for anyone to take part in shaping our 
> roadmap and contributing in any way. Our [project status](https://docs.winglang.io/status) page includes more information about 
> stability and roadmap.

You can install Wing in a few simple steps:

1. Check out the [Prerequisites](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/installation#prerequisites).
2. Install the [Wing CLI](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/installation#wing-cli).
3. Get the [Wing IDE Extension](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/installation#wing-ide-extension) for your favorite editor.
4. Launch the [Wing Console](https://docs.winglang.io/getting-started/installation#wing-console) and take it for a spin!

## FAQs ‚ùì

### What makes Wing a good fit for cloud development? üåü

Wing was built from the ground up to make it an ideal choice for building applications on AWS or other cloud providers.
Some of these features include:

* [Cloud services](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/resources) as first-class citizens.
* Higher level of cloud abstraction with a [standard library](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/wingsdk-spec).
* [Distributed computing primitives](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights).
* [Compiler plugins](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/compiler-plugins) for customization.
* [JavaScript interoperability](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#5-interoperability).
* Automatic generation of IAM policies.
* [Native JSON](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#114-json-type) and schema validation support.

For a more in-depth look at Wing's features and benefits, check out our [documentation](https://docs.winglang.io/).

### Why is Wing a language, not just another library or framework? ü§î

We believe that the cloud is a new kind of computer requiring a [new programming paradigm](https://docs.winglang.io/#what-is-a-cloud-oriented-language).
While it's possible to use this new paradigm with existing languages, we're convinced that a language natively supporting it, like Wing, will take it to new heights!

### Who is behind this project? üíº

Wing is built by the folks at [Monada](https://monada.co) and an amazing community of contributors from around the world.

Monada was founded by [Elad Ben-Israel](https://github.com/eladb) and [Shai Bar](https://github.com/ShaiBer) with the mission to democratize the cloud by building tools and services that unleash its full potential.

The language specification, toolchain and local simulator are released under the MIT license and will always be free to use. We see ourselves as the shepherds of the project through its incubation and hope to donate it to an open-source foundation so it will be eventually be community governed.

The **Wing Console** is Monada's first product. It is designed to be an amazing companion for building Wing applications. We don't have plans to charge for local development, but have some ideas for adding production capabilities to the Wing Console that we plan to charge for.
