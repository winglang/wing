# Sprint 8


It is an early morning in the heart of Tel Aviv, a CEO wakes up and heads out to waycup, his favorite coffee shop. 
He starts his day going over his emails, slack messages, his CLI based TODO app, updates from github, etcâ€¦ 
But this story is not about that CEO, nor it is about that day. 
This story is about that TODO app, and the team that created it using a completely new language called Wing

You mission, if you choose to accept it, is to implement this the following single tennant TODO app for sim and for aws:

```js

bring cloud;
bring util; // Hello util


/** 
 * Meta: async/await
 *  As of this wriring I've placed a async/await syntax here, but I am 
 *  aware that elad would love to remove it
 *  to be discussed
 **/

struct Task {
  title: str;
  completed: bool // currently we don't have defaults in the spec :(
}

struct TaskItem extends Task {
  id: str;
}


// could have been a wonderful CRUD<Task> if we had generics
resource Tasks {
  _bucket: cloud.Bucket

  init(){ 
    this._bucket = new cloud.Bucket()
  }

  async public ~list(): TaskItem[] {
    /**
     * Meta: cloud.Bucket.list().files:File[] 
     *  It would be nice to have this._bucket.list() return File[] but 
     *  I am pretty sure this will not hold water, cause there will be situations where we get and empty list 
     *  and we want to know why the list is empty:
     *   - There is no bucket
     *   - There is no permissions to read the bucket (the SDK need to include API for no permisssions scenarios  )
     *   - There are no files
     *  
     *  Hence we need to retun a FileListResponse which includeds { files: File[] }
     *  for this excersize (because we are optimistic) we can only implement that portion of the API
     **/
    let files =  await this._bucket.list().files  //  :Filles
    let mutArray = new MutArray<TaskItem>()
    for f in files {

       *  Meta: File {name:str} 
       *   Maybe this should be called file_name? (name vs full_path vs base_name)
      **/
      let id = f.name 
      /**
       * Meta: cloud.Bucket.get(path:str) : ?
       *  What is the return type here, does this return byteAttay?
       *  For now, I've decided to simply just return an interface with to_string(<encoding>)

       *  the user "thinks" about json, but there is also a disatvantage
